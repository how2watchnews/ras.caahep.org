										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">About to turn 39 in two weeks&#8217; time, Cristiano Ronaldo said that he was proud to be able to beat the likes of Erling Haaland in terms of goals scored in the previous year. A perennial defier of odds and age, Portuguese superstar Ronaldo finished 2023 as the top goalscorer in the world for club and country with 54 strikes, beating Harry Kane (52), Kylian Mbappe (52), and Erling Haaland (50). Proving naysayers wrong with goals and milestones has been a constant for Ronaldo throughout his career. And, he was glad to have done that once again even during his career&#8217;s twilight period.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I like when people doubt me. And, I proved [them wrong] again with another successful year,&#8221; Ronaldo said at the Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai on Friday. Ronaldo referred to a tumultuous period he endured in 2022 &#8212; a year in which Portugal crashed out of the World Cup from the quarterfinals following a shock defeat against surprise package Morocco after Ronaldo&#8217;s reunion with Manchester United had turned sour, eventually forcing him out of Europe &#8211; as he mentioned that he found his footing once again in his career at Al Nassr of the Saudi Pro League. &#8220;I had a little bit difficult journey last year (2022), but I am glad that that things happened because they make me feel more strong.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And, you can see that this year I had a fantastic season. I was the best goalscorer. Imagine beating animals, the young lions like Haaland for example with the goals. So, I am proud. I am 39 soon and I am still looking good. So, I am proud,&#8221; he added. Asked about his retirement plans, Ronaldo jokingly mentioned that he would still like to continue for 10 more years. &#8220;At the moment, when I will finish? I don&#8217;t know, to be honest. But, of course, it will be soon. By soon, I mean, 10 years moreâ€¦No, I am joking,&#8221; Ronaldo added.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Top seed Iga Swiatek crashed out of the Australian Open on Saturday, losing 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to Czech teenager Linda Noskova in the third round as her bid for a maiden Melbourne Park title and fifth Grand Slam trophy fell apart. The Pole, more accustomed to breezing past opponents with the odd &#8220;bagel&#8221; or 6-0 scoreline thrown in, had struggled in Melbourne, enduring a first-set tiebreak in her opener against Sofia Kenin before fighting back from the brink of defeat to oust Danielle Collins last time out. Noskova, 19, emerged as a tricky third-round opponent with three top-10 wins under her belt, but Swiatek looked in no mood to be dragged into another dogfight as she broke in the sixth game and held to love in the next to take charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 22-year-old barely let the intensity drop after taking the first set as she forced Melbourne Park debutant Noskova into uncomfortable positions in the second by working the angles and launching big forehands. But the Czech held firm, responding with some explosive hitting of her own and breaking en route to levelling up the contest before heaping the pressure on the four-times major champion to take a 2-1 lead in the decider. Swiatek looked to have composed herself during a brief pause in play as doctors attended to a sick supporter in the crowd and broke back, but Noskova did not relent and got her nose in front again to close out the match on serve and complete a huge upset.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Arsenal&#8217;s Brazilian defender #06 Gabriel Magalhaes celebrates after scoring his team first goal during the English Premier League football match between Arsenal and Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium in London on January 20, 2024. Photo: AFP Arsenal breathed new life into their Premier League title challenge as a 5-0 win over Crystal Palace got the Gunners back to winning ways. Centre-back Gabriel did most of the damage before half-time as he headed in the opener then forced Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson into an own goal. Leandro Trossard made it 3-0 on the hour mark before substitute Gabriel Martinelli struck twice in stoppage time. Victory moves Mikel Arteta&#8217;s men level with Manchester City and Aston Villa, two points behind leaders Liverpool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Arsenal had won just once in seven games prior to a two-week winter break. However, a warm weather training camp in Dubai looked to have refreshed last season&#8217;s runners-up, even if they did have very obliging visitors in struggling Palace. The Eagles have won just once in 12 games to leave them still perilously poised above the relegation zone and pile the pressure on 76-year-old boss Roy Hodgson. Arsenal&#8217;s lack of a natural goalscorer up front has been scrutinised during their downturn in form and the fact it was one of his defenders that ended a barren run in front of goal will remain a concern for Arteta. No side has scored more goals from set pieces in the Premier League this season than Arsenal and it was two corners that undid Palace before half-time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gabriel outmuscled Chris Richards to rise highest to meet Declan Rice&#8217;s delivery with a downward header to settle the home side&#8217;s nerves just 11 minutes in. Palace were largely restricted to pot shots from long range as Jefferson Lerma tested David Raya after the goalkeeper&#8217;s poor clearance gifted possession to the Colombian. But they did not learn their lesson as Gabriel again got ahead of Richards to meet Bukayo Saka&#8217;s corner and the ball rebounded in off the unfortunate Henderson. Hodgson was booed by his own fans after substituting Eberechi Eze during Wednesday&#8217;s 1-0 FA Cup defeat at Everton to keep the England international fresh for the trip to the Emirates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The closest Eze came to making an impact was another long-range effort that Raya was forced to turn behind. But to compound Palace&#8217;s set-piece shambles, they then conceded from one of their own. Raya collected a cross into the box and quickly set Gabriel Jesus galloping free on the counter-attack. The Brazilian crossed for Trossard, who kept his cool to cut inside Nathanial Clyne and smash home his seventh goal of the season. Defeat leaves Palace still five points above the relegation zone. And a banner unfurled in the away end in the closing stages will do little to help Hodgson&#8217;s case to remain until the end of the season. &#8220;Wasted potential on and off the pitch, weak decisions taking us backwards,&#8221; was the message from the Palace fans aimed at co-owner and chairman Steve Parish. Martinelli rubbed salt in the wounds by coming off the bench to score twice in stoppage time. The Brazilian had been dropped after scoring just two goals in the Premier League all season. But he doubled that tally in a matter of seconds as he twice coolly slotted past Henderson into the far corner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Manchester United&#8217;s miserable season hit a new low as they crashed to a dismal 2-1 defeat at Premier League strugglers Nottingham Forest on Saturday. Erik ten Hag&#8217;s side produced a wretched display that was punished by Morgan Gibbs-White&#8217;s late winner at the City Ground. Nicolas Dominguez had put Forest ahead in the second half before Marcus Rashford equalised with just his third goal of a woeful campaign. United&#8217;s fourth loss in their last six games in all competitions left them languishing in seventh place in the Premier League, nine points adrift of the top four. United&#8217;s stirring fightback from two goals down to beat Aston Villa 3-2 on Tuesday had been heralded as the start of a new era just days after Jim Ratcliffe&#8217;s investment in the troubled club.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">British billionaire Ratcliffe purchased a 25 percent stake in United for around Â£1.03 billion ($1.3 billion) on Christmas Eve. Ratcliffe&#8217;s INEOS Group will take control of United&#8217;s football operations from unpopular owners the Glazer family. But despite Ten Hag&#8217;s claim on Friday that Ratcliffe wants to work with him, this was the latest evidence that the new regime might consider dismissing the beleaguered Dutchman. INEOS&#8217;s head of sport Dave Brailsford was watching alongside the club&#8217;s former boss Alex Ferguson at the City Ground as United were beaten by Forest for the first time since 1994.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ten Hag will have to oversee a significant improvement in United&#8217;s results and performances to avoid the axe. Forest moved five points clear of the relegation zone after Nuno Espirito Santo masterminded his second successive high-profile victory. Nuno&#8217;s first win as Forest boss after replacing the sacked Steve Cooper came against Newcastle, but this was an even bigger scalp. After their slow start against Villa, Ten Hag&#8217;s men once again laboured to find any rhythm as passes went astray with alarming regularity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Forest had conceded more goals than any other Premier League team in 2023, but it took 32 minutes for United to muster their first shot. Even then, Aaron Wan-Bissaka&#8217;s deflected effort trickled tamely to Forest keeper Matt Turner.Ten Hag&#8217;s furrowed brow as he stood glumly on the touchline painted a vivid picture of United&#8217;s struggles. Elanga was allowed to leave United in the close-season, while the underachieving Antony, hand-picked by Ten Hag from his old club Ajax, remains in the team. However, it was Elanga, playing with a point to prove, who looked the more dynamic force and it was no surprise when Antony was hauled off after 53 minutes, leaving the Brazilian without a goal or assist in 21 appearances.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">United striker Rasmus Hojlund, who scored his first Premier League goal to seal the Villa victory, was sidelined due to illness. Rashford, playing as United&#8217;s central striker in Hojlund&#8217;s absence, might have ended up on the scoresheet, but he hardly looked convincing in the role. Diogo Dalot fired against the post from 25 yards as United finally pieced together an incisive attack. But United&#8217;s turgid display got what it deserved in the 64th minute when Gonzalo Montiel&#8217;s pass picked out Dominguez and he slotted a cool finish past Andre Onana from 12 yards. As Forest fans serenaded Ten Hag with chants of &#8220;you&#8217;re getting sacked in the morning&#8221;, United&#8217;s Alejandro Garnacho looped a half-volley onto the roof of the net from Bruno Fernandes&#8217; corner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Turner gifted United an equaliser with 12 minutes left when his woeful pass was intercepted by Garnacho, who teed up Rashford to fire past the red-faced keeper from 10 yards. But even that belated Christmas present wasn&#8217;t enough to save United, who combusted again in the 82nd minute. Undone by sloppy marking as Elanga provided the assist, United stood statuesque as Gibbs-White curled a superb strike past Onana from the edge of the area. Making amends for his earlier mistake, Turner saved from Fernandes in stoppage-time to leave United in turmoil.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Erik ten Hag slammed his Manchester United flops after Saturday&#8217;s dismal 2-1 defeat at Nottingham Forest condemned the troubled club to their worst start to a season since 1930. Ten Hag accused his players of lacking energy and motivation during an awful first half display in which they mustered just one shot. It got even worse for the beleaguered United boss after the interval as Nicolas Dominguez put struggling Forest ahead. Marcus Rashford equalised with just his third goal this term, but Morgan Gibbs-White&#8217;s late strike handed United a fourth defeat in their last six games in all competitions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s disappointing. The loss was unnecessary. We lost it in the first half. We weren&#8217;t energised enough or invested enough, Ten Hag said. We should invest more in the first half. In the second we were better. In the first half we should have created some moments and we didn&#8217;t. We know these results are below our standards The players are not happy with this but we have to do better. United, nine points adrift of the top four, have lost nine of their opening 20 league games for the first time since 1989-90. It is now 14 defeats in all competitions for seventh placed United this season &#8212; the last time they had more heading into the new year was 1930-31. They finished 2023 with 21 defeats in all competitions, an unwanted figure they have only surpassed three times in their illustrious history.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Asked to explain United&#8217;s disastrous form, Ten Hag blamed the injuries that have denied him key players at various points in the campaign. The injuries. Also some issues but mainly the injuries hold us back in the process. In January we have a lot of players returning so then our levels can be higher,&#8221; he said. We had to change again so every time we have to swap our team. That doesn&#8217;t help or support the routines of the team and it explains why you are so inconsistent. We had nine different partnerships in the back. It doesn&#8217;t matter as well, the fans don&#8217;t want to hear this, they want to see us winning and that is what we have to serve them.&#8221; United&#8217;s first defeat to Forest since 1994 came in front of Dave Brailsford, who serves as the head of sport for the club&#8217;s new investors INEOS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brailsford, seated next to United&#8217;s former boss Alex Ferguson at the City Ground, is the right-hand man to INEOS chief Jim Ratcliffe. British billionaire Ratcliffe will head United&#8217;s football operations after buying 25 percent of the club from unpopular owners for the Glazers on Christmas Eve. Asked what he thought Brailsford would take from United&#8217;s woeful performance, Ten Hag referenced the absence of ill striker Rasmus Hojlund, who scored the winner against Aston Villa in the previous game. Definitely he will see we have our problems. You want to build on the last result but we had to change our striker,&#8221; Ten Hag said. Yet to speak to Ratcliffe and his group, Ten Hag is facing a fight to avoid the sack. But the former Ajax boss remains adamant he can turn the tide at a club drifting dangerously off-course. It will happen. No doubt about that, he said. We will work together to set high targets of course for achievements and structures. We will talk about that.&#8221;</p>
